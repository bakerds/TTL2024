# Introduction

## Internet Exchange Peering

In this session, we will talk about IU13's move into Internet Exchange peering -- connecting our wide area network directly to Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Cloudflare, and more content providers at 100 Gbps. Peering is a cost-effective way to improve network performance by reducing latency and increasing available bandwidth. We will talk about Internet transit and peering architecture and look at data demonstrating the impacts and benefits of peering. We will be joined by Akio Sugeno, Vice President of Internet Engineering at Telehouse America, who will share knowledge from his more than 30 years of Internet engineering experience.

Join us!
